# DLL-VMC-master_Serp
 Civ 5 DLL mod, based on whowards DLL v94:  http://www.picknmixmods.com/mods/CivV/DLL/Various%20Mod%20Components.html

I added various fixed, especially for multiplayer and also added few new features, partly my own work, partly from Community Patch (https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL) and partly from Artifical Unintelligence (https://github.com/DelnarErsike/Civ5-Artificial-Unintelligence-DLL)
